    <h1>Marissa's Hobbies</h1>
    You may be asking yourself, What does Marissa like to do in her spare time?
    I present my answer in list form, from most favorite to least, most favorite!   
        <ol>
            <h2><li>Coding!</h2></li>
                I find myself itching to solve problems even at this beginner level.
                This is a brain itch that’s been going for a long time. And i think
                I found the perfect scratch.
            <h2><li>Video Games:</h2></li>
                I'm more of a casual player, meaning you won't ever find me playing 
                the most optimized playthrough of any game. I find the experience is most
                important. If I can be completely engrossed for hours at a time, you've got
                yourself a pretty good game. Another is re-playability. If I’m willing to start
                over from scratch again, to try and make my game experience better, then 
                that’s top notch design to me.
            <h2><li>Reading:</h2></li>
                A relatable underdog story is what my heart wants most when on literary adventure. 
                Mixing good and bad, presenting moral dilemmas that leave you suddenly rooting for 
                antagonist, is the kind of drama I crave. Thought provoking arguments against the status quo
                is food for this brain. Now, I'm still searching for a new book I can't put down.

            <h2><li>Playing with my puppy!</h2></li>
                Rusty is still a puppy despite his size. And he has a lot of energy to burn.
                So running around like 2 goofies in a random field takes up a good portion of my off days.
            <h2><li>Fun In The Sun and Water Stuff!</h2></li>
                This really has no limit to what I would do. I'm obsessed with jet skiing. I love going on cruises.
                Anything fun where I can look silly and still have a great time. If I cant go to the beach, 
                I'll spend at least a morning sitting at the pool absorbing a little sunshine.
                Plants are definitely onto something with this one.
            <h2><li>Youtube.</h2></li>
                I like to say google is my professor and Youtube is my instructor. I'm always watching anything from
                someone turning cotton balls into cotton candy using complex chemical reaction, to Mike Rowe's Explores
                series. I love diving into different subjects that I would otherwise never be exposed to.
