    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Marissa. On the internet I'm called Lalah Minori.
            I've recently gone through what I'm calling my transformation era. In this, I'm
            rediscovering new and fun activities. Also, taking the time to re-evaluate what is
            important to me and where I want my life to go.
        </p>
        <p>
            After a fairly long period of reflection, I have decided what I really want in life 
            is to enjoy the things I love. And here recently, that means more time with my puppy Rusty!
        </p>

        <p>
            I like to call him goofus. He is my very smart but very simple Pupperoo.
            He is the catalyst for all the changes I'm taking on. The plan for my life is
            simple.
            <ol>
                <li>Complete my degree doing something I love and enjoy</li>
                <li>Find a career that will allow me to retire and earn a comfortable living wage until then</li>
                <li>Buy a house with a large back yard and a pool.</li>
                <li>Adopt 2 or 3 more puppies</li>
                <li>Enjoy going to the lake with my posse of 4 legged friends</li>
                <li>Build a tiny home bus and travel around the world in retirement.</li>
            </ol>
            I'll do whatever I have to do in order to accomplish these goals because ultimately, 
            they will lead me the happiest version of myself.
